Descriptions of each page:
Index/Home Page: Contains an about me for gym shark to familarize the user with the company, and contains contact info so people can reach out. It also has a photo of the gym shark logo (which I couldn't figure out how to center). Uses P, header, and img tags.

Clothing and Accessories Page: Contains 3 bootstrap cards that display the different items being sold on each page, with one page showing clothing and the other focusing on accessories. 

All pages contain nav bars that change the order of the links slightly depending on what page your on. The nav bar also has a photo of the gymshark logo.


Bootstrap made my programming experience more difficult, as while the pre written css is kind of convienent, I had to learn many new terms and a whole new method of writing code which I am still unaccustomed too.


I followed my mvp plan really closely, mostly because it was easy to follow,I didn't have too much time and didn't feel the need to get fancy with it.

Im most proud of the my use of rows and colummns on the first page that I used because I've always have the colummn and row thing kind of confusing.

If I had more time I'd probably make the search bar functional and add more hand written css styling so the page looks nicer.
